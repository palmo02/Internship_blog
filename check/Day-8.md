<h1>DAY-8</h1>
From morning i been doing some research on static, dynamic analysis and github, for past day we been studying our own as we dont have any assigment to do <br><br>

<h2>Tropic that i explore today </h2>
1. static analysis <br>
2. github set up <br>
3. github command<br>

<u>1.static analysis </u>:<br>
 What is static code analysis?
- refer to the operation performed by a source code analysis tool,which is the analysis of a set of code against a set of coding rules

<u>When it performed ?</u><br>
-static code analysis is performed early in development ,before software testing begin.


whatâ€™s the difference between static analysis and dynamic analysis?


Static analysis identifies defects before you run a program (e.g., between coding and unit testing).

Dynamic code analysis  identifies defects after you run a program (e.g., during unit testing). However, some coding errors might not surface during unit testing. So, there are defects that dynamic testing might miss that static code analysis can find.

<u>2. github set up :</u>

GIT:It is a tools that help to track the changes in code or your project ,and it store all the history of your project or code in from of VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM 

-it is popular 
-it is free and open source 
-it is fast and scalable 

<u>why git is helpful?</u>

-it use to track your history of your project or code ,
-it is collaborated 

GITHUB:
-It is website that allow developer to store and manage their code using https://github.com , and you can upload your project in folder form .
- you can also check other person github profile or thier project and also other can check your github 

<u>3.GITHUB COMMAND ARE :</u>
<ul>
<li>git init -initailize (start)</li>
<li>git status(it check the modified file)</li>
<li>git add(it will add the file )</li>
<li>git commit -m "first commit"(it will save file in local)</li>
<li>git remote add origin https://github.com/palmo02/Internship_blog.git( it will link the local system with git hub)</li>
<li>git remote -v ( it will check the link between the local and git hub)</li>
<li>git push -u origin main( it will upload the file to the git hub from local sysyem)</li>
<li>git branch -M main ( it will change the branch name to main)</li>
<li>git log(it will check the status of the commit file  )</li>
</ul>
